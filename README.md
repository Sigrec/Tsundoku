## Important
### P.S. This Application is Something I Do For Fun during my Free Time
### Usage
1. Download the zip file and extract all files, it should extract a folder named *"Tsundoku*" with a *"Tsundoku.exe*" file in it
2. If you are updating your app read **1.** otherwise if you are a new user read **2.**
   1. Replace the exe in your other *"Tsundoku*" folder with the new one you just downloaded and you are done
   2. If you are a new user and this is your first time using Tsundoku you can leave it as is and move the *"Tsundoku*" folder to any location in your drive.
3. Do not delete or move any files that are inside the *"Tsundoku*" folder, instead just pin the *"Tsundoku.exe*" file to your taskbar and run it.

### Reporting Bugs/Issues
To report a issue please go to the issues link [Tsundoku Issues](https://github.com/Sigrec/TsundokuApp/issues) and create a issue ticket explaining the problem and how I can reproduce it. You can check back anytime to see if the ticket is completed and what version the change was made in.

### Removing Annoying Windows Defender
Of course I understand if you do not trust me but I promise there is nothing malicious in the executable. The windows defender should turn off after the first time you run it but in case it does not here is a link to add an exclusion [Windows Security Exclusion](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26)
