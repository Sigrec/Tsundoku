## Important

### How to Update
1. Download the zip file and extract all files, it should extract a folder named *"Tsundoku*" with a *"Tsundoku.exe*" file in it
2. 1. Replace the exe in your *"Tsundoku*" folder that has all of your current data with the new one you just downloaded and you are done.
3. Do not delete or move any files that are inside the *"Tsundoku*" folder, instead just pin the *"Tsundoku.exe*" file to your taskbar and run it.

### Removing Annoying Windows Defender
Of course I understand if you do not trust me but I promise there is nothing malicious in the executable. The windows defender should turn off after the first time you run it but in case it does not here is a link to add an exclusion [Windows Security Exclusion](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26)
