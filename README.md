### This Application is Something I Do For Fun during my Free Time

>**[Windows Download (v1.3.0)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p85xxdqfhs2?hl=en-us&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare)**

If you lose or delete the UserData.json file you will lose your entire collection, so do not delete it, otherwise you  will have to start over again (you can create a backup if needed), the Covers folder is visible incase a user wants to change the image shown for a particular series, just make sure u copy the EXACT name and extension (always `.png`) from the image file.
